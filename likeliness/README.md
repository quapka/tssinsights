The folder `policies` contains various examples of policies,
where I tried to see how the _likeliness_, i.e. using `<NUM>@` in the
`or` policies, e.g., `or(9@pk(A), pk(B))` affects the final Script,
when compiled through Miniscript.

The filenames are trying to be descriptive, but aren't always. `cat` the
files inside `policies` directory and pipe them to `miniscript` to see the
differences.
